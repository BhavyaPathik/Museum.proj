   <center><i>Human Evolutionary history</i></center>
   <p>The saga of humanity began millions of years ago in Africa, where early hominins like Australopithecus eventually gave rise to our genus, Homo. From Homo habilis (2.3-1.4 million years ago) first known for crafting Oldowan tools to Homo erectus, whose larger brains and new technologies allowed migration across Africa, Eurasia, and beyond. As cognition evolved, so did creativity: symbolic behaviors such as cave painting, ritual burial, and decorative objects emerged, marking the dawn of human culture. Archaeological frameworks tools, fossils, and cave art reveal how our ancestors adapted physically, intellectually, and socially over time, transitioning from survival driven beings to symbolic, culture-making creators.</p>

   <h4><u>Start of Early Humans:</u></h4>
      <h4>Early Hominins</h4>
        <p>The earliest known human ancestors appeared in Africa. Species like <i>Sahelanthropus tchadensis</i> and <i>Orrorin tugenensis</i> showed early signs of walking upright. These primitive beings mark the starting point of the long journey from ape like creatures to modern humans. Time period about ~7-4 million years ago.</p>

        <br/>
      <h4>Australopithecus</h4>
        <p><i>Australopithecus</i> species, especially A. afarensis (famous for “Lucy”), were early bipedal hominins with small brains. They lived both in trees and on land, representing a crucial transition between apes and the genus Homo. Time period about ~4-2 million years ago.</p>

        <br/>
      <h4>Homo habilis</h4>
        <p>Known as “Handy Man,” <i>Homo habilis</i> was the first human ancestor to make stone tools. These simple tools mark the beginning of technological development and a growing brain capacity in early humans. Time period about ~2.4-1.4 million years ago.</p>

        <br/>
      <h4>Homo erectus</h4>
        <p><i>Homo erectus</i> had a more modern body and a significantly larger brain. This species is known for controlling fire, creating more advanced tools, and being the first to migrate out of Africa into Europe and Asia. Time period about ~1.9 million-110,000 years ago.</p>

        <br/>
      <h4>Neanderthals & Denisovans</h4>
        <p>Neanderthals lived in Europe and parts of Asia, building shelters, using tools, and possibly having language. Denisovans lived in Asia and are known mostly through genetic evidence. Modern humans share DNA with both, proving there was interbreeding between species. Time period around ~400,000 - 40,000 years ago.</p>

     <h4>Homo sapiens</h4>
       <p>Modern humans evolved in Africa and gradually spread across the globe. <i>Homo sapiens</i> created complex tools, art, music, and rituals. Early cave paintings and burial sites show the rise of imagination, belief systems, and symbolic thinking. Time period about ~300,000 years ago - present.</p>

     <h4>Agricultural & Cultural Revolution</h4>
       <p>With the rise of agriculture, humans shifted from nomadic hunter gatherers to settled farmers. Villages formed, animals were domesticated, and early societies developed tools, pottery, and religious symbols. This period laid the foundation for civilization. started around ~12,000 years ago.</p>

   <center><i>Prehistoric human Art, culture and practices</i></center>
   <br/>
   <center><p>Prehistoric human culture was rich with symbolic meaning, expressed through cave paintings, carved figurines, and burial rituals. Artworks like the animal murals in Lascaux and the Venus figurines of Europe reflect both aesthetic skill and spiritual thought, suggesting early beliefs in fertility, survival, and the supernatural. Tools and ornaments were crafted with care, often from bone, stone, or shell. Burial practices some involving red ochre, grave goods, or careful placement of bodies hint at a growing awareness of life, death, and possibly the afterlife. These cultural practices mark the dawn of human creativity, social structure, and symbolic communication, long before the invention of writing or cities.</p></center>

<!--here begins the art and cultural exhibiton :D -->
      <h4><u>Start of Prehistorichuma art, culture and practices</u></h4>
      <h4>Cave Paintings (Dawn of human expression)</h4>
        <p>Among the earliest and most mysterious signs of human creativity are prehistoric cave paintings, dating back over 40,000 years. Found on the walls and ceilings of caves across Europe, Asia, and even Indonesia, these artworks reveal the cognitive and spiritual awakening of early humans. The most iconic examples include the Lascaux Caves in France, where delicate outlines of bulls, deer, and horses stretch across cavern walls, and Altamira in Spain, home to vivid bison painted with natural pigments like ochre and charcoal.These paintings weren't just decoration they likely held ritual or symbolic meaning, possibly related to hunting magic, communication, or early belief systems. Some sites, like Chauvet Cave, show complex compositions and even attempts at perspective, defying the notion of "primitiv" art. In Sulawesi, Indonesia, hand stencils and wild pig figures date to a similar period, proving that this creative explosion wasn't confined to Europe alone.Archaeologists believe these artworks were made using rudimentary tools like brushes made from animal hair, hollow reeds for blowing pigment, and natural dyes sourced from earth minerals. The very act of entering deep, dark caves to paint reflects a powerful early human connection to imagination, memory, and shared culture.</p>

      <h4>Stone tools</h4>
        <p>Stone tools represent the earliest and most enduring evidence of human ingenuity. From the simple flakes of early hominins like Australopithecus, to the more advanced hand axes and scrapers crafted by Homo erectus, these tools not only shaped daily survival but also marked key transitions in cognitive and motor skills. The Oldowan tools, dating back over 2.6 million years, reflect basic chopping and cutting techniques, while the Acheulean hand axes—symmetrical, multi-purpose, and widespread—highlighted increased planning and skill. Later cultures, like the Mousterian (used by Neanderthals), produced specialized tools for hunting, hide-working, and woodworking. These artifacts are far more than implements; they are a direct window into early human's problem-solving, adaptability, and social transmission of knowledge. In museum collections today, stone tools offer not just a timeline of technological progress, but a universal symbol of early human culture and resilience.</p>

      <h4>Prehistoric Human Clothing</h4>
        <p>Prehistoric humans did not merely wear clothing for protection they gradually developed garments as tools of identity, innovation, and culture. Early clothing likely began with animal hides and furs, used by <i>Homo erectus</i>and <i>Neanderthals</i> during colder climates. Over time, humans developed sewing tools like bone needles, allowing for more tailored garments. Evidence from sites like the Dzudzuana Cave in Georgia (dated ~30,000 years ago) shows traces of flax fibers, possibly dyed and twisted into threads, suggesting both utility and aesthetic expression. Clothing also became a cultural symbol: <i>Neanderthals</i> and early <i>Homo sapiens</i> adorned themselves with beads, shells, and ochre pigments, reflecting ritual, social status, or group identity. These early fashion choices offer deep insights into cognitive and symbolic behavior, showcasing how clothing evolved alongside human creativity, social development, and environmental adaptation</p>
